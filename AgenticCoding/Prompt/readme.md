# Actor Model + Reactive Streams Code Implementation by Claude Code

**Reactive Streams** is a specification from the Java ecosystem that standardizes asynchronous data processing and flow control (Backpressure). It was officially announced in 2015 with participation from major companies including Netflix, Lightbend, and Pivotal. Since Java 9, it has been included as the Flow API, making it an official JVM standard. Various frameworks such as Spring WebFlux, Akka Streams, Project Reactor, and RxJava provide reliability and consistency in asynchronous stream processing based on this specification. It has particularly become a core technology for high-speed data transmission, streaming analytics, and WebSocket-based real-time services.

**Actor Model** is a concept that constructs distributed systems with independent actor units where state can only be changed through messages. It has the advantage of safely solving concurrency problems while being easily scalable horizontally. Through implementations like Erlang/OTP, Akka (Lightbend), and Microsoft Orleans, global companies such as WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Tesla, and Microsoft have successfully utilized it for real-time communication, IoT, gaming, and AI agents. It works well with event-based architectures and provides excellent structures for orchestrating complex business logic and AI pipelines.

## Project Purpose

Even without knowing the actor model, you can create various sample functions using actors through Vibe.
However, by attempting various actor implementations through Vibe, the purpose is to shorten the time according to the learning curve while simultaneously cultivating advanced design capabilities by performing state programming/distributed processing design capabilities supported by actor systems, including clusters, locally.

## Follow-up Actions
When unit tests were requested but the build passes and after several attempts it gets finalized, the following follow-up actions:
- Some unit tests fail; improve so all pass
